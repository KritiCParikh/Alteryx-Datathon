# Alteryx-Datathon

### Reporting CbC Tax Insights for The Walt Disney Company

This was a 32 hour Datathon where our team worked on streamlining the development of a scalable process flow in Alteryx, aimed at producing datasets for OECDâ€™s "country by country" tax report while extracting actionable insights for management. Our work involved cleaning up data from 2020 and preparing it for 2021 analysis. We found interesting insights like income changes and tax trends, helping management make better decisions. Our project underscores the collective dedication towards optimizing tax reporting processes and facilitating informed decision-making while utilizing the Alteryx tool to generate workflows.
