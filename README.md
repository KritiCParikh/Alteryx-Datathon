# Alteryx-Datathon

### Reporting CbC Tax Insights for The Walt Disney Company

* Participated in a 32-hour Datathon at the University of Texas at Dallas, where our team analyzed an international annual revenue database containing 250+ entities of the Walt Disney Company. We aggregated and analyzed region-specific tax returns to produce a comprehensive country-by-country financial report, identifying global tax responsibilities.
* Developed an Alteryx workflow to import and join different data files with the master data, performing various data preparation steps and filtering columns based on the problem statement. Our efforts streamlined the creation of a scalable process flow in Alteryx, aimed at generating datasets for the OECD's "country by country" tax report.
* Cleaned and prepared data from 2020 for 2021 analysis, uncovering insights like income changes and tax trends that informed management decisions. Our project highlights the team's dedication to optimizing tax reporting processes and facilitating informed decision-making through the use of Alteryx for workflow generation.

Thank You. Letâ€™s keep learning and growing together!
